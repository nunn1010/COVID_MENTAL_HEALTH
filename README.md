# COVID_MENTAL_HEALTH
Project assessing the impact of COVID-19 on mental health through social listening and search term analysis
Project Abstract


# Problem Statement

COVID-19 has significantly disrupted all facets of life for Canadians. Accordingly, multiple studies1,2,3  have demonstrated the significant impact that the pandemic has had on the mental health of Canadians. As the pandemic persists and restrictions continue to fluctuate throughout the country, Canadians are likely to continue facing mental health challenges. In order to effectively address these issues, it is important to understand the types of services that are likely to see increased demand over time. Additionally, understanding how mental health issues related to COVID-19 vary across demographics and regions may help to effectively allocate resources to meet growing demands. 



# Research Questions

Can we predict changes in demand for mental health services as a result of COVID-19 response?

How can we use this data to more effectively allocate mental health resources across regions and demographics?


# Data Sources

Twitter & Reddit posts (extracted in raw format from social listening tools)

Website search data (ex: Google Trends)

Social Media: 
File size: 3078 KB (~5000 mentions)

Google Trends Data:
File size: 3 KB (csv extract from Google Trends)





# Approach

Social media posts relating to mental health and COVID-19 will be retrieved via query within social listening tools and extracted in raw form. Demographic data will be attached to the extent possible for each post, including gender and location data. These posts will be classified into mental health indications and analyzed over time to detect changes in volume and sensitivity to COVID-19 related events. Additional data from Google Search trends of related keywords will be integrated to build a full picture of resource demand within each mental health indication.


# Techniques Used



NLP
Processing social posts for analysis
Classification of posts into various mental health indications by topic and sentiment attribution


Time-series
Analysis of trends in mental health topic interest over time in response to COVID-19 measures
Predictive model for resource demand in response COVID-19 measures



By understanding the volume & context of COVID-19 related social posts and search queries over time using the methods outlined above, a model will be developed to predict where mental health resource demand is likely to increase. This will allow agencies to respond preemptively, meeting the needs of Canadians struggling with mental health problems during COVID-19
